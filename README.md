# collegeproject-carrentalsystem
This is the project designed by me and my project partner samrat Basnet during our 7th sem under the requirement to complete the course content. 
This project deals with the car management system in Nepal to provide the best service to rent a car on basis of car used per day and in really reasonable price to go outing and picnics in the holidays.
